First, create the word-count-example database, including views and documents

  $ ruby insert.rb

Then, run the queries:

  $ ruby query.rb

If you have time for a sophisticated example, try the Markov Chain demo script
(where $WORD is a standard English word that may appear in the documents):

  $ ruby markov.rb $WORD
